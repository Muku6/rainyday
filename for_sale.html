                        <h3 class="heading-fill">Sizing</h3>

                        <p>
                            The difference between a Men's and Women's shoe size used to be stated as 2 sizes difference. Rather recently I've been hearing and reading that the difference between them is 1&half; sizes. It can also vary depending on the brand as well as material the shoe is made from. Don't take it as a hard and fast rule. Width of your foot can play a role in this all as well. What is displayed is what is shown in shoe, for your convenience. (For example, a Men's size 10 shoe would be equivilant of a Woman's size 12. On the flip side a Woman's size 10 shoe would be a Men's size 8.)
                        </p>

                        <h3 class="heading-fill">Tax</h3>

                        <p>
                            If you live in the state of Washington, tax will be applied on PayPal accordingly. Rainy Day Art is based in Washington state and therefore are required by state law to collect taxes from those living within the state.
                        </p>

                        <h3 class="heading-fill">Shipping</h3>

                        <p>
                            Shipping is done via Priority, with insurance, is included in all of the prices listed for those living within the contiguous United States. If you live elsewhere, such as Hawai'i, Alaska, or in another country, and are interested in a pair, please don't purchase through the Buy Now button. You will need to <a href="https://formsubmit.co/el/ximeho" target="_blank">contact me as soon as possible</a> so that I can set aside the only pair. There are only one pair available of each. Make sure to note where you live and the name of the pair of shoes you are interested in. This will allow me to calculate a shipping cost for you. Do note that <strong>any customs fee incurred will fall upon the buyer</strong>. Cost does not include possible customs fees upon entering another country.
                        </p>

                        <h3 class="heading-fill">Wear or Display</h3>

                        <p>
                            Great for wearing and showing what you enjoy. Or even displaying it as an art piece for a collection. Whatever you want to do with your creation is up to you!

                            Saitama appears! And not far behind him is Genos to remind you to keep your story short! (Very short!) This pair of Vans got the One Punch Man love. Genoes appears on the left shoe, while Saitama adorns the right shoe. Their names appear on the back of the shoe they are painted on.

                            The '90s cult classic -- Ren & Stimpy! Ren appears as Commander on the left shoe, while Cadet Stimpy appears on the right shoe. The inside of the shoes has a space theme! It's honestly what gave me the idea for something space-based at least! Bottom image hopefully gives you a better idea of the them inside of the shoe.
