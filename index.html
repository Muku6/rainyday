                        <p>
                            Rainy Day Art is about bringing your favorite characters and/or ideas to life on a new pair of shoes for you to enjoy wearing or display! Rainy Day is about bringing your new pair of shoes to life with some pizzaz. Not something you'll find in the store. And best of all, it's how you want it!
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Feel free to check out my <a href="portfolio.html">Portfolio page</a> to see the work I've crafted so far. It should give you a little bit better idea of what I can do and how I can help you craft your own new pair of kicks. We can discuss ideas you have and explore ways to get you what you're looking for! You can contact me on social media, but you can also just send me a message with questions, comments, etc. Thank you for visiting my website and I look forward to talking with you soon!

                    <h2>What is Rainy Day Art?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Rainy Day Art started off in 2020 as Rainy Day Shoes. The idea was to create custom shoes for those seeking something special to wear or display. It was something I had on my mind for months, but at the start of the pandemic decided to act upon it.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I've also changed the branding from Rainy Day Shoes to Rainy Day Art to focus on the art aspect. I may be open to commissions of art of other kinds. But shoes are my main focus at the moment.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I'm just a one lady operation here. I'm based up in the great Pacific Northwest of the United States. Art has always been part of my life in one way or another. As time and technology has gone on, some of it has also gone digital. I'm hoping to bring some of the physical art to you though with a brand new pair of shoes that you are looking to have made into reality.
