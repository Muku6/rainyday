                    <p>
                        My name is Heather and it is a pleasure to have you visiting. I am owner of Rainy Day Art, which happens to be my freelance website and business. I'm am a one woman operation. Currently I live in the great Pacific Northwest of the United States. This is how I came up with the name Rainy Day, and maybe even a little bit of the logo. But don't let anyone fool you. It does rain a lot up here.

                    <p class="a-para-tlbr-spacing">
                        Art has been part of my life in some form or another for the majority of my life. I grew up drawing and enjoying it. I've been to college in different art programs as well. I've done 3D computer art, but didn't enjoy it as going back to the basics. I went back to that with my schooling in Japan. Even finding classes like woodblock printing enjoyable.
                    </p>

                    <p class="a-para-tlbr-spacing">
                        In late 2019 I was trying to figure out what I wanted to do for some time. I wanted to launch a side business deal. One day it just hit me. I worked in the shoe department at my work. I could bring art to the shoe space. I did some research and practice. Those practice shoes would also become part of my portfolio and part of my beginning For Sale selection. At the start of 2020 is when I decided to bring Rainy Day to life and see where it would took me.

                    <p class="a-para-tlbr-spacing">
                        This is something I do for fun as a side business to bring in a little additional money. I still very much work a regular job. So bear in mind I may not respond to everyone as quickly as I'd like to. But I do hope that this gives you a better idea of who I am. Please take a look at <a href="portfolio.html">my Portfolio page</a> to see if I have anything that might pique your interest. I look forward to working with you!
